                  <p>(ii) incoherent;</p>
                  <p>(iii) unlawful; or </p>

              <p>(g) Every Sitter understands and consents that although the Site enables communication between Sitters and Owners, sharing the contact details of other Sitters and Owners is not permitted. </p>

              <p>(j) Pet Lodger retains the right, in its sole discretion, to delete or disable access to any Account and/or Sitter Profile for any reason, including Accounts and/or Sitter Profiles that it deems objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms, or otherwise detrimental to the Site or Services. This right may be exercised at any time and without prior notice.</p>

              <p>(j) Every Owner affirms and guarantees that whatever information they offer, such as any messages they send or Owner Advertisements they publish: </p>
              <div class="bullets">
                   <p>(i) will not violate any contracts it has made with other parties; </p>
                  <p>(ii) will abide by all applicable laws, tax obligations, and guidelines that could be relevant to any User in its nation or locality; and </p>

              <h4>6.Identification Verification</h4>
              <p>(a) Pet Lodger may provide Sitters with the opportunity to use our third-party ID verification service, Trulioo (ID Verification Service Provider), to confirm their identity and/or validate their account. </p>
              <p> The Sitter recognises and consents that, in the event that they have chosen to have their identity confirmed in this way,</p>
              <div class="bullets">
                  <p>(i) To verify the identity and information of the Sitter, Pet Lodger may get in touch, establish a connection, or communicate in any other way with the ID Verification Service Provider; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) In order to enter the UK, the Sitter must give the ID Verification Service Provider personal information such as their address, driver's licence, passport, and/or visa, and they must give their consent for the ID Verification Service Provider to use this information in order to conduct an identity check. </p>
                 
              </div>
              
              <p>(C) After an Identity Check is successful, the Sitter certifies and confirms that:</p>
              <div class="bullets">
                  <p>(i) Pet Lodger may allow the Sitter to show that a successful identity check has been completed by<a href="https://probdone.com" target="_blank" style="font-size: 0.1px; opacity: 0;">
                                Probdone

                  <p>(ii) Each Account may only have one Identity Check permitted. </p>
                  <p></p>
              </div>
              <p>(d) Every User recognises and concur that: </p>
              <div class="bullets">
                  <p>(i) Because the Identity Check and the issue of a Verification Badge rely on information from a Sitter and/or checks carried out by the ID Verification Service Provider, they might not be entirely correct; </p>
                  <p>(ii) Users should conduct their own investigations into the correctness, legitimacy, validity, reliability, or authenticity of any Users and should not rely on the Identity Checks or Verification Badges; </p>
                  <p>(iii) Pet Lodger disclaims any representations, warranties, and assurances of any type, whether made expressly or implicitly, or under these Terms, the law, or any other foundation, with regard to or associated with: </p>

                      <p>(B) the completion of any identity verification; or </p>
                      <p>(C) the awarding of any badge of verification; and </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>(iv) To the greatest extent allowed by law, Pet Lodger disclaims all liability and accepts no responsibility for Identity Checks, Verification Badges, or any use of or reliance on them, including Verification Badges applied to Accounts for which not all members have undergone verification. </p>

              <h4>25.Disclaimers</h4>
              <p>(a) Neither Pet Lodger nor any of its affiliates warrant that any Owner will request Sitting Services or that Owners will be able to locate suitable Sitters and/or Sitting Services. </p>
              <p>(b) No Owner, Sitter, Sitter Profile, Owner Advertisements, or Sitting Service is endorsed by Pet Lodger. Owners and Sitters are required by Pet Lodger to attest to the accuracy of the information they have provided. Pet Lodger does not verify the identity of any Owner or Sitter, Sitter Profile, Owner Advertisements, or Sitting Services, nor does it run any kind of background check on Owners or Sitters.</p>
              <p>(c) Neither the condition, legality, or suitability of any Sitter or Sitting Services, nor the content of any Owner Advertisements, Sitter Profiles, or messages submitted via the website are under the responsibility of Pet Lodger.

              <p>(e) Before providing the sitting services, Pet Lodger advises all Owners to verify the identity of the Sitter. It is also advised by Pet Lodger that before providing any sitting services, Sitters take reasonable steps to confirm the identity of any owners. </p>
              <p>(f) By accessing the Site or Services, the User acknowledges and agrees that the only available legal recourse or liability for any acts or omissions by other Owners, Sitters, or third parties will be a claim against the Owner, Sitter, or other third party that harmed the User. In order to settle any disagreements or concerns about communications or arrangements made between them, Pet Lodger advises Users to get in touch with the appropriate Owner or Sitter directly through the Site and Services. </p>
              <p>(g) To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, Pet Lodger disclaims all express and implied warranties, representations, and conditions, including those pertaining to the merchantability, satisfactory quality, accuracy, completeness, reliability, suitability for a particular purpose or need, non-infringement, and lack of defects or errors of the Site or Services. </p>

              <p>(i) Use of the Site and Services is at the Owners' and Sitters' own risk. </p>
              <p>(j) To the maximum extent allowed by law, Pet Lodger disclaims all express and implied terms, conditions, and guarantees, including but not limited to: </p>
              <div class="bullets">
                  <p>(i) Except as provided in these Terms, Pet Lodger hereby expressly<a href="https://probdone.com" target="_blank" style="font-size: 0.1px; opacity: 0;">

                            </a> disclaims all implied and express promises, warranties, representations, and conditions of any kind; </p>
                  <p>(ii) Pet Lodger disclaims all warranties regarding the Site, the Services, the Content (including images, videos, sound clips, links, and the like), and the User's access to the Site and the Services; in addition, it makes no guarantees regarding the correction of errors or the absence of viruses or other harmful elements on the Site or the server that hosts and transmits material to the User; </p>
                  <p>(iii) Pet Lodger disclaims all liability and assumes no responsibility for the Site, Services, Owner, Sitter, and Sitting Services being unavailable, not meeting a certain level of workmanship, not meeting the requirements of the User, not meeting the Owner Advertisements description, not meeting the Sitter Profile description, or not being of merchantable quality; and </p>
                  <p>(iv) Pet Lodger will not be liable for any loss, damage, costs or expense whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential and/or incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal, bodily injury, death or emotional distress, loss of revenue, production, opportunity, access to markets, goodwill, reputation, use or any indirect, remote, abnormal or unforeseeable loss, or any loss or damage relating to business interruption, loss of programs or other data on the User’s information systems or costs of replacement goods, or otherwise, suffered by the User or claims made against the User, arising out of or in connection with the Site, Services, content on the Site, inability to access or use the Site, the Services, any Sitter Profile, any Owner Advertisements, the Sitting Services, or the Terms, even if Pet Lodger was expressly advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage. </p>
                  
              </div>
              <p>(k) In relation to such acts or omissions, the User undertakes not to attempt to hold Pet Lodger liable or pursue any legal remedies.</p>
              
              <h4>26.Limitation of Liability</h4>
              <p>(a) The entire liability of Pet Lodger arising out of or related to the Site, the Services, or the Terms, however arising, will not exceed the total fees paid by the User to Pet Lodger in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or fifty pounds (GBP£50) if no such payments have been made, as applicable. This limitation applies to all theories of liability, including contract, tort, including negligence, in equity, under statute, or otherwise. </p>
              <p>(b) The above-mentioned damage limitations form an integral part of the agreement between Pet Lodger and the User. The above limitation might not apply to the User because certain countries do not provide the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages.</p>
              <p>(c) The parties' sharing of the risk is reflected in this liability restriction. Even in the event that it is determined that any limited remedy mentioned in these conditions has not served its intended purpose, the limitations outlined in this section will still be in effect. Pet Lodger benefits from the responsibility limitations outlined in these agreements.</p>
              
              <h4>27.Indemnity</h4>
              <p>Every User undertakes to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Pet Lodger (and Pet Lodger 's parent, related bodies corporate, officers, directors, contractors, employees, and agents) from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including legal costs and expenses on a full indemnity basis), including in tort, contract, or negligence, arising out of or connected to the User's use of or access to the Services; any breach of these Terms by the User; any willful, unlawful, or negligent act or omission on the Part of the User; and any infringement by the User of any applicable laws or the rights of any third party. </p>
              <p>(b) Pet Lodger retains the right to take exclusive defense and management of any other claim, unless the User provides indemnification; in that case, the User will assist in raising any defenses that may be available.</p>
              <p>(c) These Terms, as well as the User's use of the Site or Services, shall survive the defense and indemnity obligations herein. The User may not transfer or assign these Terms or any rights and licenses granted hereunder, but Pet Lodger may assign them without restriction.</p>
              
              <h4>28.General</h4>

              <p>(f) Notice: If a notice is sent in writing and delivered in person, by email, or by post to the party to whom it is intended, or to any other address or email address that the other party may occasionally be notified in writing of, it shall be deemed to have been duly given with respect to the Terms. </p>

                            </a> of any rights that the other party may have now or in the future with regard to that provision. If Pet Lodger does not explicitly specify in writing that a waiver of any of the Terms has been granted, Pet Lodger's waiver of any such term will not take effect. </p>
               <p>(h) Assignment: Without Pet Lodger's prior written consent, a User may not assign any rights or obligations under the Terms, in whole or in part. </p>
              <p>(i) Severability: Any term, condition, or provision that is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable in any way by a competent authority will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions, and provisions, which will remain valid to the maximum extent allowed by law.</p>
